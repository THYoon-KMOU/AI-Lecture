# Multidimensional Time Series Analysis using LSTM Autoencoder

This repository contains a research project focusing on the analysis of multidimensional time series data using LSTM Autoencoder. We study common features represented by the latent vectors produced by the encoder. The comparison analysis is performed using various scalers (Standard Scaler, MinMax Scaler, Robust Scaler) and multiple timesteps.

## Experimental Results

So far, the optimal batch size has been found to be 256, and the most effective timestep is 20.

## Model Structure

The following figure outlines the structure of the LSTM Autoencoder:
